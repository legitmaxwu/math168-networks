# Math 168 Final Project

This is the accompanying code for our paper: "SEIR Simulations on a Human Interaction Network".

Important files:
- `augment.ipynb`: Markovian data generation implementation and code explanation. It is used to generate `data/generated_data.csv`, which is not included in this repository.
- `seir_sim.ipynb`: SEIR simulation implementation. It uses `generated_data.csv`, which is generated by `augment.ipynb`.
